Roboto is a sans-serif typeface family introduced with Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. Google describes
the font as "modern, yet approachable" and "emotional". The font is licensed under the Apache license.
The entire font family was officially made available for free download on January 12, 2012 on the newly launched
Android Design website. The family includes regular and oblique styles of Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black,
and Condensed widths.

The font was designed entirely in-house at Google by Christian Robertson, an interface designer for Google.

The font itself - as well as this little wrapper library - is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.
